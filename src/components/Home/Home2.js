              <i><b className="purple"> I wrote my first code in 2015. </b></i> Between 2017
              and 2019, I worked on frontend and backend development in the Mobile App and Web fields. 
              Towards the end of 2019, I was introduced to Game Development and have been actively developing games since then. 
              I started my first professional job in the game industry in 2020. I have been a <i><b className="purple"> Professional Game Developer </b></i> for about <i><b className="purple"> 4 years </b></i> now.
              <br/>
              <br/>I am fluent in
              <i><b className="purple"> C#, Unity </b></i>
              <br />
              <br />
              I have been actively involved in dozens of game projects so far. While I mostly took on roles as a programmer, I have also assumed the role of team leader in many teams.
              <i><b className="purple"> Project Management </b></i>, <i><b className="purple"> Strong Communication </b></i> and <i><b className="purple"> Being a Good Teammate </b></i> are the qualities I am proud of.
